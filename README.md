# Terraria-Tile-Generator

Before you download the generator, make sure python 3 is installed, added to your %PATH% and %PYTHONPATH%, tkinter is installed and pip is installed.

Some dependencies must be installed before using this script, open up a terminal window and type in: 'pip3 install pillow numpy' (Without quotes).

Code has been updated to write properly on a modern version of numpy.

Original credits go to ghost20000, none of the code is mine and I am only uploading it since the repo link is dead. Some modifications had been made to the original code such as the ability to name the template.
Credit to ProjectET for saving this neat little code snippet from becoming lost to the eather.
